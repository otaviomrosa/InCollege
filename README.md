# InCollege COBOL Program

This project is a **menu-driven simulation** of the InCollege application, written in **COBOL**.  
It allows users to:
- Create an account (with validation rules)
- Log in with an existing account
- Search for jobs (placeholder feature)
- Find and connect with other users
- Send and see connection requests
- Create and edit personal profiles
- Learn new skills (placeholder feature)
- Logout and return to the initial menu
- Exit the application safely while saving account data

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) installed on your machine  
  (On macOS/Linux you can usually install via `brew install gnu-cobol` or your package manager).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

Run the following command to compile:

```bash
cobc -x -free -o InCollege InCollege.cob
```

This will create an executable named `InCollege`.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Program

Run the program with:

```bash
./InCollege
```

The program expects an **input file** (`InCollege-Input.txt`) to simulate user input.

## üìÇ Files Used

- **`InCollege-Input.txt`** ‚Üí Input file  
  Contains the sequence of menu choices and text the user would normally type interactively.

- **`InCollege-Output.txt`** ‚Üí Output file  
  All messages displayed by the program are also written to this file.

- **`InCollege-Accounts.txt`** ‚Üí Account storage  
  Stores created usernames and passwords between runs.  
  - If this file does not exist when running the code, proper output will not be generated using our input file, so please refer to the info below about the accounts information we used in our cod.
  - Maximum **5 accounts** can be created.
  - the accounts we use for our code
  alice               Aa1!aaaa
  bob                 Abcdef1!
  carol               Abcdefg1!
  dave                AbcDef1!Gh$Q
  eve                 Aa1!aaaaa

- **`InCollege-Profiles.txt`** ‚Üí Profile storage  
  Stores user profile information including personal details, education, and work experience.
  - Created automatically when users create their first profile.

- **`InCollege-Pending-Requests.txt`** ‚Üí Connection requests storage  
  Stores pending connection requests between users.
  - Created automatically when the first connection request is sent.
